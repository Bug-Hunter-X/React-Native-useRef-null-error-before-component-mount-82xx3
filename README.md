This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native when using the `useRef` hook. The error occurs when accessing the `current` property of the ref before the component has mounted. This can lead to a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'someProperty')` error.  The solution demonstrates how to safely handle the null value by checking if `myRef.current` is null before accessing its properties.
