This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with a functional component.  The `current` property of the ref is initially `null` and accessing it before the component has mounted or after it has unmounted can lead to unexpected behavior.  For example, if you attempt to access `myRef.current.someProperty` before the ref has been attached to the DOM element, you will get a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'someProperty')`. This can happen if you try to access the ref within the `useEffect` hook before the component has mounted.
